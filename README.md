- Better site stucture : 
1. provides your site with sitelinks.(Sitelinks are a listing format in the SERPs that show your site’s main page along with several internal links)
  - Sitelinks:
    - increase vavigability
    - point users to most relevent information
    - increase your brands reputation
    - improve user trust
    - dominate SERP's
    - increase clickthrough rate
    - shorten the conversion funnel
    
2. means better crawling. (The better your site structure, the easier the crawlers, such s Googlebot, can access and index the content.)


## Six steps to creating site structure

1. Plan out a hierarchy before you develop your website. (A “hierarchy” is nothing more than a way to organize your information — something that is simple and makes sense. Your hierarchy will also become your navigation and your URL structure, so everything important begins here. Keep the number of main categories between two and seven. Unless you’re Amazon.com, you don’t want to have too many main categories. Try to balance the number of subcategories within each category. Basically, try to keep it approximately even. If one main category has fourteen subcategories while another main category has only three subcategories, this could become a little unbalanced.)
2. Create a URL structure that follows your navigation hierarchy. (The second main element in developing strong site structure is your URL structure. If you’ve logically thought through your hierarchy, this shouldn’t be too difficult. Your URL structure follows your hierarchy.)
3. Create your site navigation in HTML or CSS. (Coding in JavaScript, Flash, and AJAX will limit the crawler’s ability to cover your site’s well-thought-out navigation and hierarchy.)
4. Use a shallow depth navigation structure. (Your navigation structure will obviously follow your site hierarchy. Make sure the pages, especially important ones, aren’t buried too deep within the site. Shallow sites work better, both from a usability and crawler perspective)
5. Create a header that lists your main navigation pages. (Your top header should list out your main pages. That’s it. Adding any other menu elements apart from your main categories can become distracting and unnecessary. If you’ve designed a parallax site, be sure to provide a persistent header menu that displays through each scrolling phase. While dropdown menus using CSS effects or disappearing menus may provide a unique or intriguing user experience, they do not enhance SEO. I advise against them. I also advise against using an image-based navigational structure. Text links with appropriate anchors provide the strongest form of SEO. If you have a footer with menu links, be sure to duplicate the main links of your top navigational menu in your footer navigation menu. Changing the order of links or adding additional category listings will complicate the user experience.)
6. Develop a comprehensive internal linking structure.(they allow users to navigate a website, help establish information hierarchy for the given website, and they help spread link juice (ranking power) around websites. ach of these is directly tied to creating a tight-knit and well-integrated site structure. There’s no need to get complicated with internal linking. The basic idea is that every page on your website should have some link to and some link from another page on the website. Your navigation should accomplish internal linking to the main categories and subcategory pages, but you should also make sure that leaf-level pages have internal linking as well.)
